## Introduction
- The goal of this group project was to create a React application and self learn the set up and use of a backend server.  We wrote a dataset, connected it to PostgresSQL using Knex and deployed the api and app using Heroku.
- Radiance is an app that promotes self-care with mental and emotional wellness.  A user can use the app to start their day by generating a random affirmation and set an intention for their day.  They are also able to favorite the affirmations that they resonate with the most and view them on the favorites page.
